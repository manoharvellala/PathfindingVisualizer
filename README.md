# PathfindingVisualizer
Welcome to Pathfinding Visualizer! I created this application out of my passion for exploring pathfinding algorithms and the desire to showcase their functionality through engaging visualizations. Used Vanilla JavaScript to comprehensively illustrate intricate Graph Algorithms, including SWARM, Dijkstraâ€™s, BFS, and DFS.
